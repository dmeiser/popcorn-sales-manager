"""AppSync resolvers module for GraphQL API.

This module provides modular resolver creation for the AppSync GraphQL API,
organized into:
- mutations: Mutation resolvers (create, update, delete operations)
- queries: Query resolvers (read operations)
- fields: Field resolvers (nested type resolution)
