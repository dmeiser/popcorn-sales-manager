"""
Cognito Pre-Sign-Up Lambda Trigger

Automatically links federated identity providers (Google, Facebook) to existing
Cognito users with the same verified email. This prevents duplicate accounts when a user
signs up with email/password first, then later signs in with a social provider.

Trigger: Pre Sign Up
Event: Before a new user is created (for both native and federated sign-ups)

How it works:
1. When a federated user (e.g., Google) attempts to sign in for the first time
2. Cognito triggers Pre Sign Up before creating the user
3. This Lambda checks if a native user with the same email already exists
4. If so, it links the federated identity to the existing user
5. Then raises an exception to prevent duplicate user creation
6. The user is then signed in with the existing account
